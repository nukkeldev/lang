# `patch`

`patch` is a batteries-included programming language with a focus on extremely quick iteration times and developer experience. This repository includes the `patch` CLI program with two primary tools: `patch i` and `patch x`.

## `patch i`

A visual "time-travelling" debugger for `patch`, allows for developers to run their program, pause, modify the program, go back to before the modification, and then resume.
This leads to extremely quick iteration times and an excellent developer experience.

## `patch x`

A compiler for `patch` that produces executables for `patch` programs.
